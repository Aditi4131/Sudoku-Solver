# Sudoku-Solver
This is a simple and fully functional Sudoku Solver application built using Java with a Swing-based GUI. It allows users to solve Sudoku puzzles either by entering their own numbers or by solving a sample pre-filled grid.

The core logic is implemented using the Backtracking algorithm, a classic method used in constraint satisfaction problems like Sudoku. The GUI is created using a 9Ã—9 grid of JTextField components, styled with a dark theme and bordered cells to mimic a real Sudoku board.

 Features:
 
Interactive 9x9 Sudoku grid

Pre-filled sample puzzle on launch

Solve button to compute the solution using backtracking

Clear button to reset the entire grid

Dark theme UI with clear visibility

Simple design and easy to use

This project helped me understand how to integrate algorithms with GUI applications and improved my skills in Java Swing and recursive problem-solving.
